                   <p>Eagle Flight Chaplain is a Non Governmental Organisation, fully registered by the federal Government of Nigeria under the Corporate Affairs Commission in 2015.We are a Christian Organisation that engages in reaching out to students in the schools, prisoners in the prison/correctional centers, reaching out to the sick in hospitals and praying for them, as well as reaching out to the public through Crusades in cities and villages<br>
                    
                    The Chaplaincy is a military-like organisation in line with St. Martins' dream, who happened to be a military officer that rendered help to a beggar in the cold season by giving him his jacket to cover up against the cold. He was however visited by Christ for that help, and this brought about the Chaplain Movemnet in the military till today, to assist officers even during wars and periods of crisis.<br><br>
                    We are in various states across the nation presently. We are currently recruiting officers and also training  them for the task ahead. <br>We are training for the following:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rescue team for accident victims on highways. We often collaborate with the Red Cross Society in preparing men for the task.</li>
                        <li>We currently have a Prison ministry Outreach dedicated to preaching the Gospel to prisoners, and bring peace to the nations and the world</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    We do have internal security policing during crusade and other evemts.
